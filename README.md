# Java-Data-Structures

Simple project which uses the most common java structures ArrayDeque, ArrayList, HashMap, List, Map, Queue, Map, TreeMap. 

This project doesn't have a functional purpose. It's just for learning data structures in java, catching exceptions with input and output, learning how to use regular expressions and object serialization.

More to updates to come.
